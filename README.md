# Decision-Tree-Predicting-Maternal-Health-Risk-Level

Here I created a Decision Tree Model that predicts the maternal health risk level.
This is of great importance as it tells us if a particular individual will face pregnancy complications later on.
The dataset used may be found on the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository website (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/863/maternal+health+risk).
